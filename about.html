                <h1>Who Am I?</h1>
                <p1>Growing up homeschooled, I have always had a unique perspective on life. While other kids had traditional experiences like school lunches, field trips, and bonding with classmates, I did not get the pleasure of experiencing these things until high school. While I was homeschooled, I used a lot of my free time diving into the world of computers. Whether it was taking the back off my mom’s Blackberry, opening up the back of my laptop, or venturing through the intricate redstone and command system in Minecraft, I was always fascinated by technology. Eventually, around the age of 13, I built my own computer. I watched hours worth of YouTube videos to learn about how computers work and how they are put together. I decided on which parts would work the best for what I wanted, ordered them, and finally built the system. Technology isn’t the only thing I enjoy, however. I frequently spend my time reading fantasy novels, running, hanging out with friends, or playing video games. I also spent five years of my life in Texas, which taught me a lot about other cultures, especially how they treat others. My dream is to one day venture into the world of Software Engineering, and I will do whatever I can to achieve that dream.</p1>

                <h1>Why hire me?</h1>
                <p1>I have always had a love for uniting others. Whether it is my classmates in a group project, crew members I work with, or friends who seem to hate each other for no reason, if I have the opportunity to help others work in unity, I will have done my job. Having the skill to come up with an idea, write a program, debug it, then launch it is very important to being an engineer; However, a team full of the most competent engineers but no leader would still be far less effective than a mediocre team that has a great leader. That is what I bring to the table: Leadership. I love to practice my skills, and I enjoy learning new things as often as I can, but that can only take me so far. I strive to be a leader, both in my place of work and in my community.</p1>
